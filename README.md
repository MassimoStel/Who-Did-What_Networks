In WP1, we also aim to design and implement a novel framework for getting deeper knowledge structures: Who-Did-What cognitive networks will measure bias through its actors, actions and consequences. Who-Did-What networks are semantic/syntactic multilayer networks with 3 layers, i.e. subjects (WHO), actions/verbs (DID) and consequences (WHAT). Part-of-speech tagging is determined by an AI reading each sentence in a text (e.g. spaCy). Inter-layer connections are established by means of syntactic parsing with AI (e.g. spaCy), highlighted in gray above. Intra-layer connections are semantic and established only if two words are synonyms (e.g. father and dad), highlighted in green above. Like in textual forma mentis networks (Stella, PeerJ Comp. Sci, 2020), individual concepts are labelled as “positive” (cyan), “negative” (red) and “neutral” (gray) according to a mega-study in psychology (e.g. NRC Emotional Lexicon). Inter-layer paths like the indigo one indicate “who did what” - i.e. which actions and which consequences were portrayed by specific agents in texts. In the indigo paths, positive actors did positive outcomes through two synonymous actions, one neutral and one positive. Whereas TFMNs through EmoAtlas can give general results, about the overall context of biased perceptions, we expect for Who-Did-What networks to complement TFMNs by providing a focus on actors, actions and consequences.
