def get_verb_subjects(verb):
    """
    Retrieve the subjects of a given verb, including through coordination and inheritance.
    Coordination refers to when multiple subjects are linked by a conjunction (e.g., "and" or "or") and share the same verb.
    Inheritance occurs when a subject is implied from a previous clause or sentence and applies to a following verb without being explicitly repeated.

    For compound nouns, each component is included separately.

    PASSIVE VOICE HANDLING:
      Uses ``_passive_info()`` to detect three types of passive constructions:
        1. Canonical passive (auxpass / nsubjpass) — e.g. "I was raped by X".
        2. Feel-passive (non-modal aux + VBN) — e.g. "I felt abused by X".
        3. Agent-phrase passive (VBN + by-phrase) — e.g. "She seemed targeted by Y".

      - Passive WITH explicit agent ("by Y"):
          Y (pobj of the agent prep) is the semantic agent → goes to Agent.
          X (patient) → goes to Target via ``get_verb_objects()``.
      - Passive WITHOUT explicit agent ("I was raped", "I felt abused"):
          X (patient) stays in Agent as best-available approximation;
          flagged with ``passive_approx=1`` in the output DataFrame.
      - Coordinated passive ("X was written and reviewed by Y"):
          The agent may be a child of a conj verb, not of ROOT.
          ``_passive_info()`` searches conj children as well.

    Args:
        verb: The verb token.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]: A list of tuples containing the main subject and its prepositional phrases.
