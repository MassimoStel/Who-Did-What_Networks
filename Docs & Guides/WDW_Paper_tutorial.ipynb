        "This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the Who-Did-What (WDW) network framework to analyze textual data. WDW networks provide a unique way to narrative analysis by focusing on the actors (WHO), actions (DID), and consequences (WHAT) portrayed in texts, constructing a multilayer semantic-syntactic network.\n",
