    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Who-Did-What package provides tools for extracting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples from textual data, resolving coreferences, and visualizing the extracted relationships as graphs. It's designed to assist in natural language processing tasks such as information extraction, text analysis, and knowledge graph construction.\n",
    "Currently, the package only works in English.\n",

    "How the Package Works\n",
    "The package processes text to extract SVO triples and builds a graph representing the relationships. Here's a high-level overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning: Removes unnecessary characters and spaces.\n",
    "Coreference Resolution: Replaces pronouns with the nouns they refer to using fastcoref or stanza.\n",
    "SVO Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizes spaCy for dependency parsing to identify subjects, verbs, and objects.\n",
    "Handles various grammatical structures, including compound subjects/objects and passive voice.\n",
    "Graph Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts extracted SVO triples into a graph using networkx.\n",
    "Nodes represent subjects, verbs, and objects.\n",
    "Edges represent the relationships between them, including semantic relations like synonyms.\n",
    "Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses matplotlib to visualize the graph.\n",
    "Nodes are color-coded based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "Edges are styled to represent different types of relationships.\n",
    "Usage Guide\n",
    "1. Importing the Package\n",
    "First, import the necessary functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from your_package_name import extract_svos_from_text, plot_svo_graph\n",
    "Replace your_package_name with the actual name of the package or the script file if you're running it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extracting SVOs from Text\n",
    "Use the extract_svos_from_text function to process your text:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "text = \"Alice went to the market. She bought apples.\"\n",
    "svos_df = extract_svos_from_text(text)\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "text (str): The input text to process.\n",
    "coref_solver (str, optional): The coreference resolution tool to use ('fastcoref' or 'stanza'). Default is 'fastcoref'.\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "A pandas DataFrame containing the extracted SVO triples and additional metadata.\n",
    "3. Visualizing the SVO Graph\n",
    "Use the plot_svo_graph function to visualize the relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "plot_svo_graph(svos_df)\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "df (DataFrame): The DataFrame returned by extract_svos_from_text.\n",
    "subject_filter (str, optional): Filter the graph to focus on a specific subject.\n",
    "object_filter (str, optional): Filter the graph to focus on a specific object.\n",
    "4. Filtering the Graph\n",
    "You can filter the visualization to focus on specific subjects or objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Filter by subject\n",
    "plot_svo_graph(svos_df, subject_filter='Alice')\n",

    "Example 3: Complex Sentences with Multiple SVOs\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "text = \"\"\"\n",

    "# Using stanza\n",
    "svos_df = extract_svos_from_text(text, coref_solver='stanza')\n",
    "Valence Computation\n",
    "The package computes the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of words, which influences node coloring in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization\n",
    "You can modify visualization settings or extend the extraction functions to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Troubleshooting and Tips\n",
    "Performance: Processing large texts may take time due to coreference resolution and parsing.\n",
    "Dependencies: Ensure all models and data are properly downloaded to avoid errors.\n",
    "Extending Functionality: The code is modular; you can integrate additional NLP tasks as needed.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This package offers a robust solution for extracting and visualizing SVO relationships in text, aiding in various NLP applications. Whether you're conducting text analysis or building knowledge graphs, this tool provides a solid foundation.\n",
